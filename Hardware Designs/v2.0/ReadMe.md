# Updated Design

The initial design was tested and a few changes were made, making the device more efficient and safe than the previous design. The changes will be mentioned below.

The usage of soda lime was also tested to bring out the maximum efficiency. Iterative experiments were carried out, by emulating the exhaled gas of a person with a CO<sub>2</sub> supplied to a container having the same amount of soda lime. The details of the experiment and the outcome is mentioned in the directory 'Sodalime'.

## Modifications in Design
- The valve have been brought out from the bottle lid, which allows easy replacement.
- An additional breathing bag is added after the venturi valve
- The PEEP outlet is coupled with exhalation port before entering the bottle to save wastage and better use of soda lime
