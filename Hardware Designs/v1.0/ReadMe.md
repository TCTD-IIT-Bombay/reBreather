# Initial Design

The initial design was done keeping prototyping time to a bare minimum and our goal was to document the science behind the technique and that it can actually work in real life. 

This design has been tested on a healthy team member who was hooked up to a patient monitoring device, under the supervision of clinical specialists.  His vital signs, breathing rate, inhalation & exhalation O<sub>2</sub> CO<sub>2</sub>  levels were monitored.

At a low O<sub>2</sub>  input flow rate of 1 L/min, the volunteer was able to maintain normal breathing patterns with O<sub>2</sub>  and CO<sub>2</sub>  levels well within limits. We were able to establish that CO<sub>2</sub>  is continuously being removed from the system.


## Known Issues
- The absorption process of C0<sub>2</sub> by sodalime is an exothermic reaction and the bottle will get warm during the process. We also tried pushing a large flow rate of pure C0<sub>2</sub> into the bottle and we did find that the PET bottle we used has a chance to get warped due to the heat. Potential alternatives are to pursue with thicker(2-3mm) acrylic tubes which has a higher deformation temperature. 
- The unidirectional valves do contain quite a number of parts which isn't that optimal for scalable designs. This is making the assembly process longer. We are working on simplifying the valve design significantly.
